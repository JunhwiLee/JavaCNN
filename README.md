# JavaCNN

JavaCNN is a minimal Convolutional Neural Network library written in Java. It
provides basic building blocks like layers, nodes and activation functions.

## Building

Compile the sources with `javac` and place the results in the `bin` directory:

```bash
javac -d bin src/CNN/*.java
```

## Running

This project does not ship with a demo application. After compiling, include
the `bin` directory on your classpath to use the library in your own code.
